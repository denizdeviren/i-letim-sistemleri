# 💻 Operating Systems Laboratory Exercises

This repository contains the mandatory laboratory exercises for the Operating Systems course. The assignments focus on fundamental system calls, process management, and file I/O operations in a Unix-like environment, all implemented using the **C programming language**.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To compile and run any exercise:

1.  Navigate to the specific example folder (e.g., `example-01/`).
2.  Compile the source code:
    ```bash
    $ gcc main.c -o app
    ```
3.  Execute the binary:
    ```bash
    $ ./app
    ```

## 📁 Repository Structure

The project maintains a strict, consistent folder structure. Each of the 10 exercises resides in its own numbered directory, containing the three required files:

| File Name | Description | Language |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`main.c`** | The complete C source code for the application. | C |
| **`explanation.md`** | A detailed breakdown of the exercise's purpose, the system calls used, and the program's working mechanism. | **English** |
| **`app`** | The compiled executable binary file, generated by GCC. | Binary |

The overall structure for the completed 10 mandatory labs is:
